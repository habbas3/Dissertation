  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequence length (32), with significant domain shift between source and target chemistries, favoring a high-capacity model with domain adaptation. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data with physics-inspired edits, improving transfer across chemistries. SNGP and use_unknown_head address uncertainty and out-of-distribution risks due to label inconsistency and chemistry mismatch. Dropout at 0.3 balances regularization to prevent overfitting on small source domains, and a moderate bottleneck (256) supports sufficient representation without excessive compute."
