  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and a short sequence length (32), with label inconsistency and domain shift between cathode chemistries. WideResNet_edited is tuned for battery data and handles domain gaps well. Using SNGP and an unknown head helps manage uncertainty and out-of-distribution risks from chemistry mismatch. A moderate bottleneck (256) balances capacity and regularization, dropout at 0.35 prevents overfitting, and a learning rate of 0.0005 aligns with dataset hints. Batch size 32 fits memory and training stability, and warmup epochs help stabilize transfer learning."
