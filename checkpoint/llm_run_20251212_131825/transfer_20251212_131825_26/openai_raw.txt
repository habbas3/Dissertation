  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps) with label inconsistency and domain shift between source and target cathodes. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data with physics-inspired features and handles transfer gaps well. Enabling SNGP and an unknown head helps manage uncertainty and out-of-distribution cycles due to chemistry differences. Dropout at 0.3 balances regularization against overfitting, and a bottleneck of 256 provides sufficient capacity without excessive compute. Batch size 64 matches seen data, and moderate warmup stabilizes training."
