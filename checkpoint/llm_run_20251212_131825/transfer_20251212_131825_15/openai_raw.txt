  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and sequence length 32, with domain shift between source and target cathodes, requiring strong representation and transfer capability. WideResNet_edited is tuned for battery data and handles domain gaps well. Using SNGP and an unknown head helps manage uncertainty and out-of-distribution risks due to chemistry differences. Dropout at 0.35 balances overfitting risk given label inconsistency. Batch size 32 and learning rate 0.0005 align with dataset hints and stable training."
