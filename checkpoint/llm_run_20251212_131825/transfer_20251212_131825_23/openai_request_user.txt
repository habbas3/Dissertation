TRANSFER CONTEXT

Target cathode: HE5050 (high-energy experimental blend). Source cathodes: 5Vspinel (high-voltage spinel (manganese rich)). Source/target chemistries differ → expect domain shift.


DATASET CONTEXT
---------------
Dataset: Argonne National Laboratory battery aging time-series with partial cycle windows. Source cathodes: 5Vspinel; target cathodes: HE5050, NMC111, NMC532, NMC622, NMC811. Label column 'eol_class' with ~None classes; sequence length 32; 21 channels covering cycle_number, energy_charge, capacity_charge, energy_discharge, capacity_discharge, cycle_start, cycle_duration. Literature cues (Joule S2542-4351(22)00409-3, chemistry-sensitive ablations): Joule 2022 (S2542-4351(22)00409-3) key cues for chemistry-aware ablation: - Early-cycle capacity fade slopes and coulombic-efficiency stabilization highlight whether aging is lithium-inventory loss (graphite/anode-electrolyte limited) versus cathode structural decay (e.g., Ni-rich NMC cathodes with electrolyte oxidation risk). - High initial impedance growth, thick SEI signatures, or electrolyte oxidation markers flag chemistries that benefit from uncertainty-aware heads (SNGP/OpenMax) to avoid overconfident extrapolation on outlier cycles. - LFP/graphite pairs tend to show flatter voltage plateaus and slower early fade; Ni-rich NMC chemistries degrade faster under aggressive cycling and need stronger regularization or shorter cycle horizons in ablations. - Transfer between mismatched chemistries (e.g., NMC → LFP) should down-weight source loss and favor architectures that adapt quickly with self-attention or wider bottlenecks; closely matched chemistries can rely more on convolutional baselines. source_train: class counts 0:19, 1:18, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1 (example label 1). source_train sample window (first 3 ch × 12 steps): [[-1.6202000379562378, -1.388700008392334, -1.1572999954223633, -0.9258000254631042, -0.6944000124931335, -0.4629000127315521, -0.23149999976158142, 0.0, 0.23149999976158142, 0.4629000127315521, 0.6944000124931335, 0.9258000254631042], [-1.1741000413894653, -0.016899999231100082, 0.0012000000569969416, -0.030400000512599945, -0.03880000114440918, -0.04360000044107437, -0.05829999968409538,...

MODEL REFERENCE
---------------
cnn_1d — Lightweight 1-D temporal CNN Best for: Short-to-mid sequences (<256 steps) with <=8 channels, fast iteration, or when GPU memory is limited. Strengths: Low latency and easy to regularize; Works well on CWRU bearings with narrow frequency bands; Stable baseline when data is mostly closed-set Watch-outs: May underfit long-horizon battery curves; Less expressive for high-channel sensor arrays cnn_1d_sa — CNN with lightweight self-attention tail Best for: Sequences needing local feature extraction plus some long-range mixing (Argonne battery cycle slices, multi-axis sensors). Strengths: Keeps CNN efficiency while capturing multi-cycle correlations; Balances between latency and expressivity Watch-outs: Slightly higher memory than pure CNN; Attention layer can overfit tiny datasets without dropout cnn_openmax — CNN with OpenMax calibrated tail Best for: Closed-set CNN workloads where explicit unknown rejection is mandatory (e.g., CWRU with novel fault types). Strengths: Adds open-set calibration to the fast CNN backbone; Pairs well with label-inconsistent or anomaly-heavy splits Watch-outs: Assumes CNN-appropriate sequence lengths; Requires tuning OpenMax thresholds for noisy labels wideresnet — WideResNet 1-D (high capacity) Best for: Longer sequences (>=256 steps) or >8 channel inputs needing stronger representation power (battery chemo-mechanical signals). Strengths: Deep residual blocks capture rich frequency structure; Handles transfer tasks with large domain gap Watch-outs: Higher compute/memory footprint; Can overfit small CWRU subsets without augmentation wideresnet_sa — WideResNet with attention head Best for: Hybrid scenarios: long multi-channel sequences where global context matters (battery degradation trajectories). Strengths: Residual depth + attention for regime shifts; Works well when label inconsistency requires context Watch-outs: Largest memory use; ensure batch size is feasible; Needs dropout to avoid memorizing small source domains wideresnet_edited — WideResNet variant tuned for battery Best for: Argonne battery cycles with physics-inspired feature edits (e.g., state-of-health regression buckets). Strengths: Pre-activation blocks favor smooth degradation patterns; Often strongest when transfer source ≠ target chemistry Watch-outs: Less validated on vibration data; Expect longer warm-up and sensitivity to learning rate Toggles and...
