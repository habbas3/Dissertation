  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequence length (32), favoring CNN with self-attention to capture local and some long-range dependencies. The chemistry domain shift and label inconsistency suggest using SNGP and an unknown head to improve uncertainty calibration and avoid overconfident extrapolation. Dropout at 0.35 balances regularization given the moderate dataset size. Bottleneck 256 provides sufficient capacity for multi-channel battery signals. Batch size 32 matches seen data, and moderate lambda_src and warmup_epochs support stable transfer learning."
