  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps) with domain shift between source and target chemistries, favoring a high-capacity model with transfer adaptation. WideResNet_edited is tuned for battery data and handles domain gaps well. SNGP and use_unknown_head improve uncertainty calibration for outlier cycles and label inconsistency. Dropout at 0.35 balances regularization without overfitting small source data. Batch size 8 matches seen data, and moderate lambda_src and warmup_epochs support stable transfer learning."
