  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and a short sequence length (32), with domain shift between source and target chemistries. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data and transfer tasks with chemistry mismatch, providing strong representation power. Enabling SNGP and use_unknown_head helps manage uncertainty and avoid overconfident extrapolation on outlier cycles, important given label inconsistency and domain gap. Dropout at 0.35 balances regularization, and batch size 8 matches seen data. Moderate bottleneck (256) supports capacity without overfitting, and warmup_epochs 10 stabilizes training."
