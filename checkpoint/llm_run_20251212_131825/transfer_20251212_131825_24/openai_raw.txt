  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps) with label inconsistency and domain shift between source and target cathodes. WideResNet_edited is tuned for battery data and handles domain gaps well. Using SNGP and an unknown head helps manage uncertainty and avoid overconfident extrapolation on outlier cycles. A moderate bottleneck (256) balances capacity and regularization, with dropout at 0.35 to prevent overfitting. Batch size 8 matches seen data, learning rate 0.0005 is stable, and warmup_epochs 10 aids smooth adaptation."
