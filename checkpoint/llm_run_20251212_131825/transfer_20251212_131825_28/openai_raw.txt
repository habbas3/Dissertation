  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps) with domain shift between source and target chemistries, favoring a high-capacity model with transfer adaptation. WideResNet_edited is tuned for battery data and handles domain gaps well. SNGP and use_unknown_head add uncertainty awareness to mitigate overconfident extrapolation on outlier cycles due to chemistry mismatch. Dropout at 0.35 balances overfitting risk given label inconsistency, and batch size 8 matches observed data. Warmup epochs and moderate lambda_src support stable transfer learning."
