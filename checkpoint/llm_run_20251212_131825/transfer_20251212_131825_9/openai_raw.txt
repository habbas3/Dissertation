  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and sequence length 32, with domain shift between source and target cathodes, requiring strong representation and transfer capability. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data with physics-inspired edits, suitable for domain gaps. SNGP and use_unknown_head help manage uncertainty and out-of-distribution risks due to chemistry differences. Dropout 0.35 balances overfitting risk given label inconsistency, and moderate bottleneck (256) supports capacity without excessive overfitting."
