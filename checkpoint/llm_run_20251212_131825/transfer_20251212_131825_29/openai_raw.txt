  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps) with label inconsistency and domain shift between source and target chemistries. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data with domain gaps and benefits from physics-inspired feature edits. Using SNGP and an unknown head helps manage uncertainty and outlier cycles due to chemistry mismatch. Dropout at 0.35 balances regularization for small source data, and a moderate bottleneck of 256 supports capacity without overfitting. Batch size 8 matches seen data, and warmup epochs help stabilize transfer learning."
