  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and short sequences (32 steps), favoring CNN with self-attention for capturing local and multi-cycle correlations. The domain shift between source and target chemistries and label inconsistency suggest using SNGP and an uncertainty-aware head to mitigate overconfident extrapolation on out-of-distribution cycles. A moderate bottleneck (256) balances capacity and regularization, with dropout at 0.35 to prevent overfitting. Batch size 32 matches observed data, and a learning rate of 0.0005 with warmup epochs supports stable transfer learning."
