  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and sequence length 32 with label inconsistency and domain shift between source and target cathodes, favoring a high-capacity model with physics-inspired edits. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data and transfer between mismatched chemistries, handling complex chemo-mechanical signals better than lightweight CNNs. Moderate dropout (0.35) and warmup epochs (10) help regularize and stabilize training given label inconsistency. Self-attention and openmax are avoided to reduce overfitting risk and complexity given the short sequence length and moderate batch size."
