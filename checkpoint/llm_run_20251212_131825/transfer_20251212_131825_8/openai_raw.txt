  "rationale": "The dataset has 21 channels and sequence length 32, with significant domain shift between source and target cathodes, favoring a high-capacity model with transfer adaptation. WideResNet_edited is tailored for battery data with physics-inspired feature edits, improving transfer across chemistries. SNGP and use_unknown_head enable uncertainty-aware predictions to handle label inconsistency and out-of-distribution cycles. Dropout at 0.3 balances regularization to prevent overfitting on small source domains, and a moderate bottleneck of 256 supports rich feature extraction without excessive compute."
